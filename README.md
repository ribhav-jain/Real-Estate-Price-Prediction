# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
The objective is to perform data visualization to understand the insight of the data and predict the real estate price using Machine Learning.

## Steps Involved:
Visualizing Data: Plots the relation between price and various parameter.

Correlation Analysis and removing redundancies: Determine how parameters are related and removing the parameters that are not contributing.

Standardization: Useful to speed up the learning algorithm. The standardization rescales the features so that they will have the properties of the standard normal distribution with μ = 0 and σ = 1. So, rescaled each of the variables by applying the following formula on every value:
                                                                  z = x − μ / σ

#### Machine Learning:
Sampling: Dividing the data in test and train set.

Learning Algorithm: In our case it is Linear Regression. The goal was to model a relationship between y, the dependent variable and x1,..., xp.

Predict Price: Using this model we can predict the price based on various parameters related to a particular real estate.
